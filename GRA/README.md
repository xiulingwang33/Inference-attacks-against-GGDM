Step 1: run regal_diffusion_sim.py

Step 2: run regal_diffusion_align.py

To minimize potential negative consequences of this research, we do not publicly release the graph alignment module in regal_diffusion_align.py, which aligns two adjacency matrices to compute their maximum structural match. Researchers who require access to this module for legitimate academic purposes may contact us directly to request it.
